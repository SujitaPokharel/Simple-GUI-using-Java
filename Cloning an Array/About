This is a part of assignment of "Introduction to Java Programming" (CS 480) of Northwestern Polytechnic University.
This project is a Based on following instruction by professor :

  (Enable the Account class comparable & cloneable)
  Create ComparableAccount class inheritanced from  the Account class and implemented the comparable interface.
  Override the compareTo method to compare the balance of two accounts. Also override toString() method.
  
  Implements the cloneable interface and override the clone method to perform a deep copy on the dateCreated field.
  
  Write a driver program to create one array contains 5 ComparableAcccount objects (account #: 1001-1005, initial balance=$1000). 
  Make deposit $500 to each account, and withdraw $100 - $500 for each account.
  Clone all 5 accounts into a new array. 
  Print out each object info from the cloned array, and use “==“ to compare the dateCreated field of each object from both arrays. 
  Use Arrays.sort() to sort the original array and print out object info.
